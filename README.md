# ‚úèÔ∏è Blogging Front-End - FIAP Tech Challenge

This project was developed as part of Challenge 3 of FIAP's P√≥s-Tech course, focusing on building the front-end interface of a blog application. The complete design prototype was created by me in Figma before the front-end implementation. Additionally, the application is connected to an API that I developed in Challenge 2 - Blogging API, creating a complete solution for managing blog posts.

## üî® Features 

The blog application includes the following features:

- **Display All Posts:** Users can view a list of available posts.
- **View Specific Post:** Users can access detailed content for a specific post.
- **Conditional Messages:** Messages such as "No posts available" or "Error loading posts" are properly displayed in scenarios of missing content or request failures.
- **Full Responsiveness:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablets, and desktops.
- **Modular Design:** Reusable components, such as the header and footer, facilitate maintenance and expansion of the application.
- **Pagination of Posts:** The functionality to load more posts as the user navigates is fully implemented.
- **Search by Keywords:** Users can search for posts by keywords using a search bar.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The project utilizes a modern stack to ensure a performant and maintainable application:

- `Next.js:`: Framework used for creating the interface and server-side rendering.
- `TypeScript:`: Provides static typing and ensures safer development.
- `Styled Components:`: For dynamic and modular styling, ensuring consistency with the Figma prototype.
- `Axios:`: Used for making HTTP requests to the posts API (which I built in Challenge 2).  

## üëÄ Project Overview

This project started with the design of a complete prototype in Figma, where all the screens and interactions were planned with a focus on usability and responsiveness. After the prototype was ready, the front-end was developed using Next.js and TypeScript to ensure a scalable and modern application.

The application connects to the API developed in Challenge 2 - Blogging API, enabling dynamic post loading and a complete front-end and back-end integration. Dynamic routing was implemented using Next.js' App Router, with specific pages for each post's display.

How to run the project:
